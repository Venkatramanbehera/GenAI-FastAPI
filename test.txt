Based on coalescence of Mitochondrial DNA and Y Chromosome data, 
it is thought that the earliest extant lineages of anatomically modern humans 
or Homo sapiens on the Indian subcontinent had reached there from Africa between 80,000 and 50,000 years ago, 
and with high likelihood by 55,000 years ago. However, 
the earliest known modern human fossils in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.
Evidence for domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, 
and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in Balochistan, 
Pakistan after 6500 BCE. These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation, 
the first urban culture in South Asia, which flourished during 2500–1900 BCE in Pakistan 
and western India. Centred around cities such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibangan, 
and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and 
wide-ranging trade.
